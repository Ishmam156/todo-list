# To-Do App

A To-Do App that is built using vanilla JS, HTML, CSS and utilizes localStorage to persist user to-dos and projects. The app allows users to create new To-Dos and clubs them in projects, lets users change tasks priority status, update its completion status as well as finally delete the to-do when done.
